# Web Development Project 1 - *ExploreMD*

Submitted by: **Atuh Fon**

This web app: **ExploreMD is an interactive community board built with React and Vite that helps locals and visitors discover the best Maryland has to offer. From historic landmarks in Annapolis, scenic hikes along the C&O Canal, and the freshest crab houses on the Eastern Shore to the sandy shores of Ocean City and wild horses of Assateague Island, each hand-picked destination is presented as a card complete with an image, title, brief description, and a “View Location” button. Built with modern web standards—including responsive Flexbox/Grid layouts, component-based architecture, and clean, maintainable styling—ExploreMD makes browsing Maryland’s top spots simple and engaging.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Challenges

Responsive Flexbox: Getting exactly five cards per row that stay centered and top-aligned—even when some cards have more content—meant constant tweaking of flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, gap, and item basis until everything behaved across breakpoints.

Render Debugging: Pinning down “which output runs” involved tracing component imports/exports, confirming prop flows, and using console logs + React DevTools to ensure the right component was rendering at each step.

UI: Trouble figuring out how the website should look. I'm not that well verse in making eye catching UIs.
